# Harmony Search Algorithm Implementation

## Overview

This project implements a probabilistic optimization algorithm called the Harmony Search Algorithm in Python. The algorithm is designed to find the minimum of given objective functions by mimicking the process of musical improvisation. A graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed using Tkinter to allow users to interactively input parameters, run the algorithm, and visualize the results.


## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter
